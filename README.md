This repo contains examples of the [Prime Factors Kata](http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.ThePrimeFactorsKata)
using both unit tests and [property-based tests](https://8thlight.com/blog/connor-mendenhall/2013/10/31/check-your-work.html).

Examples are included in [Clojure](https://github.com/ecmendenhall/property-based-testing/tree/master/clojure), [Ruby](https://github.com/ecmendenhall/property-based-testing/tree/master/ruby), [Python](https://github.com/ecmendenhall/property-based-testing/tree/master/python), [Javascript](https://github.com/ecmendenhall/property-based-testing/tree/master/javascript), and [Java](https://github.com/ecmendenhall/property-based-testing/tree/master/java/). Please see the README file inside each folder for details on
installing dependencies and running the tests!
